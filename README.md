# AEQ-OA
## Quick Summary
There are two parts about this mini-project. Both of them are implemented by java 1.7 and both start entry are in Main.class.
(I didn't submitted the compiled jar file, so feel free to clone/download src codes to compile it.)

## Part 1.
It's straight forward calculated how many castles each Peak/Valley case need to be build.

## Part 2.
Transformer Battle.
Players need to build their transformer(s) and team up either as autobots (A) or Decepticons (D) before start battles.
For the special case, if Optimus Prime vs Predaking case, all the rest round games end. Also, all competitors destroyed, after that "Optimus Prime vs Predaking" round does the game result will be calculate as previous rounds results.
